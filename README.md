Hello, I'm Harsh, this repository is managed by me, and my aim is to keep a simple place for all the stuff and important links related to competitive exams (*mainly jee*) and that's why I choose GitHub so that it'll be easy to access and contribute

> **Note**  
> I'll also try to keep it up updated, these links and discussions are taken from internet and people who created those are ðŸ˜˜

> **Warning**  
> If any link is broken don't blame me just search for new material anywhere else and if you are a good kid, you'll add that stuff here
